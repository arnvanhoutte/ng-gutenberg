# ng-gutenberg

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.4.  
It is a desperate attempt to try to include Wordpress Gutenberg in Angular 2+. All help is appreciated

## TODO

* Import React and React-DOM in component instead of application-wide

* Set api-fetch in component instead of in polyfills

* Find a way to update the editor when navigating to it a second time

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
